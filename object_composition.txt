Reusing the implementation
>Composition:construct new object with existing objects
>It is the relationship of "has-a"

Composition
>Objects can be used	>For example, an
to build up other	Empoyee has a
objects				Name
>Ways of inclusion		Address
	Fully			Health Plan
	By reference		Salary History
>Inclusion by reference			Collection of Raise
allows sharing				objects
				Supervisor
					Another Employee object

Embedded objects
>All embedded objects are initialized
	The default constructor is called if
		you don't supply the arguments, and there is a default
		constructor(or one can be built)
>Constructors can have initialization list
	any number of objects separated by commas
	is optional
	Provide arguments to sub-constructors
>Syntax:
	name(args) [':' init-list] '{'

Public vs. Private
>It is common to make embedded objects
	private:
		~they are part of the underlying implementation
		~the new class only has part of the public interface of
		the old class
>Can embed as a public object if you want to
have the entire public interface of the
subobject available in the new object
