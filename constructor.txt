Guaranteed initialization with the constructor
>If a class has a constructor,the compiler
automatically calls that constructor at the
point an object is created,before client
programmers can get their hands on the
object.
>The name of the constructor is the same as
the name of the class

Constructors with arguments
>The constructor can have arguments to
allow you to specify how an object is
create,give it initialization values,and so on.
	Tree(int i) {...}
	Tree t(12);

The destructor
>In C++,cleanup is as important as initialization
and is therefore guaranteed with the destructor.
>The destructors is named after the name of the
calss with a leading tilde(~).The destructor never
has any arguments.

When is a destructor called?
>The destructor is called automatically by
the compiler when the object goes out of scope.
>The only evidence for a destructor casll is
the closing brace of the scope that
surrounds the object.

Storage allocation
>The compiler allocates all the storage for a
scope at the opening brace of that scope.
>The constructor call doesn't happen until
the sequence point where the object is defined.

The default constructor
>A default constructor is one that can be called
with no arguments.
