Setting limits
>to keep the client programmer's hands off
members they shouldn't touch.
>to allow the library designers to change the
internal workings of the structure without
worrying about how it will affect the client
programmer.

C++ access control
>The members of a class can be cataloged,
marked as:
	public
	private
	protected
>public means all member declarations that
follow are available to everyone.
>The private keyword means that no one
can access that member except inside
function members of that type.

Friends
>to explicitly grant access to a function that
isn't a member of the structure
>The class itself controls which code has
access to its members.
>Can declare a global function as a friend,as
well as a member function of another class,
or even an entire class,as a friend.

class vs. struct
>class defaults to private
>struct defaults to public
