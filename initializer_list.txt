Initializer list
	class Point {
	private:
		const float x, y;
		Point(float xa = 0.0, float ya = 0.0)
			: y(ya), x(xa) {}
	};
>Can initialize any type of data
	pseudo-constructor calls for built-ins
	No need to perform assignment within body of ctor
>Order of initialization is order of declaration
	Not the order in the list
	Destroyed in the reverse order

Initialization vs. assignment
	Student::Student(string s):name (s) {}
initialization
before constructor
	Student::Student (string s)
assignment
inside constructor
string must have a default constructor
