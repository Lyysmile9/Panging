File,parameters,local variables
>All three kinds of variable are able to store a value that
is appropriate to their defined type.
>Fields are define outside constructors and methods.
>Fields are used to store data that persists throughout
the life of an object.As such,they maintain the current
state of an object.They have a lifetime that lasts as long
as their object lasts.
>Field have class scope:their accessibility extend
throughout the whole class,and so they can be used
within any of the constructors or methods of the class
in which they are defined.
>As long as they are defined as private,fields cannot be
accessed from anywhere outside their defining class.
>Formal parameters and local variables persist only for
the period that a constructor or method executes.
Their lifetime is only as long as a single call,so their
values are lost between call.As such, they act as
temporary rather than permanent storage locations.
>Formal parameters are defined in the header of a
constructor or method.They recive their values from
outside,being initialized by the actual parameter values
that form part of the constructor or method call.

Call functions in a class
	Point a;
	a.print();
>There is a relationship with the function be
called and the variable calls it.
>The function itself konws it is doing
somethin with the variable.

this:the hidden parameter
>this is a hidden parameter for all member functions,
with the type of the class
	void Point::print()
>can be regarded as
	void Point::print(Point *p)

>To call the function,you must specify a variable
	Point a;
	a.print();
>can be regarded as
	Point::print(&a);

this:pointer to the caller
>Inside member functions,you can use this
as the pointer to the variable that calls the
function.
>this is a natural local variable of all class
member functions that you can not define,but
can use it directly.
