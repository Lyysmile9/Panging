new and delete
>new is the way to allocate memory as a
program runs.Pointers become the only
access to that memory.
>delete enables you to return memory to
the memory pool when you are finished
with it.

Dynamic Arrays
int *psome = new int[10];
>The new operator returns the address of
the first element of the block.
delete [] psome;
>The presence of the brackets tells the
program that it should free the whole
array,not just the element.

The new-delete mech
	int *p = new int;
	int *a = new int[10];

	Student *q = new Student();
	Student *r = new Student[10];

	delete p;
	delete [] a;
	delete q;
	delete [] r;

Tips for new and delete
>Don't use delete to free memory that
new didn't allocate.
>Don't use delete to free the same block
of memory twice in succession.
>Use delete[] if you used new [] to
allocate an array.
>Use delete(no brackets) if you used new
to allocate a single entity.
It's safe to apply delete to the null pointer
(nothing happens).
